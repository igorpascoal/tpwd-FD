#RWThemeKit SDK v0.1
##Created by Nik Fletcher, Monday 29th November 2010

As of the current HEAD, the SDK consists of two files:

- Example theme with all relevant classes added for the RapidWeaver 5.0 sitemap.
- RapidWeaver 4.x Theme SDK PDF tutorial.

We will be moving this documentation to a more SCM-friendly format (Markdown) in due course.
